# TingTing Result

You can see that the X axis of the eye is the opposite.

This is because of the difference between the webcam screen and the actual environment.

### Follow the eye

follow the webcam's eye

### Come back eye

If there is no eye in the screen, come back the center

### Re Follow the eye

When the eyes reappear, following them again does not perform well.

Because there was a frame that couldn't track the face in the dlib
